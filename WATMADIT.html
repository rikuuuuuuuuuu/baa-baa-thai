        <P>Last April 25, 2022,, Baa Baa Thai Tea was able to create an unforgettable experience for
            its employees. Held in the beautiful island resort in Lawas Seaside Resort. Led by Nessie
            Mae Jordan, our Human Resource Manager, and the rest of her team, we prepared engaging
            activities, delicious meals, and awards ceremonies for our “BaaBaaristas.”
            The celebration is not just about having fun, but it aims to: 
                <br>
                <br>
            - Strengthen the strong relationship we have among our employees.
             <br>
            -Ignite the burning passion for serving our customers happily
             <br>
            -And most importantly, to teach the importance of our mission which is to share the Baa Baa love with the people.
            Our activities were designed to create that deep connection among our employees. In this way,
            we can guide them on how to better their craft and service to the everyday people that they
            interact.
            </P>

            <p>It also delights us that our BaaBaaristas are united in their belief in creating a space where
                love is shared and celebrated. It is in their hearts to happily serve our customers. The best part of the event was reserved towards the end of our first night-- the bonfire
                sessions, which allowed us to reveal more of who they are, not just as an employee but a
                person who wanted to make an impact on their job.
                <br>
                As we approach the other half of this year, we are eager to make more meaningful activities to
                spark happiness even in the simplest moment</p>
