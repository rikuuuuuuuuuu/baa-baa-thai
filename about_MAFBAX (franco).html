        <P>Baa Baa Thai Tea is thrilled to experience one of the most sought Food and Beverage expos this
            year in Manila. MAFBEX 2022 is a five-day (June 15 to June 19) gathering of mouth-watering
            food products, interesting food discoveries, and fun activities. This was attended by more than
            300 food exhibitors, food vloggers, famous chefs, and the media.</P>

            <p>After a two-year preparation (which was derailed during the global pandemic), Baa Baa Thai
                Tea was able to tick off another milestone. Joined by our CEO, Mr. Jeowel Y De Ramos, his
                entire team was able to fulfill another mission – share the authentic Thai milk tea experience
                with many. Our hearts were flattered by the overwhelming feedback from regular customers
                and new ones. </p>

            <p><b>Thai pulled tea.</b><br>
                This is what sets us apart from the competition and other brands. Our local artisans are
                passionate in bringing out our Thai tea leaves' authentic flavor and taste. And it is what we
                showcased during the expo. Our signature Cha Yen famously known as our “Baa Baa Thai Milk
                Tea,” complemented with our chewy pearls, turned out to be a hit with all the attendees during
                the entire event run. </p>

            <p><b>Opening doors and building a happy community.</b><br>
                MAFBEX 2022 allowed us to open opportunities for entrepreneurs searching for an
                established franchise system and package. Myriads of franchise inquiries were raised during
                the five days event, which proves we are winning the hearts of many milk tea lovers and
                becoming the number 1 Thai milk tea brand in the Philippines. </p>
